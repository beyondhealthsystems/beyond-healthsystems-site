        infrastructure for large-scale financial accuracy and accountability.

        We are selective about growth and prioritize clarity of thinking,
        system-level reasoning, and execution discipline.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Look For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong analytical and systems thinking</li>
        <li>Comfort operating in complex, regulated environments</li>
        <li>Bias toward correctness, traceability, and rigor</li>
        <li>Ability to work independently and responsibly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
      <p>
        Roles are opened deliberately as the platform scales. We do not post
        broad listings.
