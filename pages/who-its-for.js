      <h1>Who It’s For</h1>

      <h2>Hospitals & Health Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations seeking to recover underpaid revenue, verify payment
        accuracy, and establish a defensible system of financial truth — without
        disrupting existing RCM operations.
      </p>

      <h2>Large Provider Groups</h2>
      <p>
        Multi-specialty and enterprise provider groups facing increasing claim
        complexity, partial payments, and payer enforcement variability.
      </p>

      <h2>RCM Organizations</h2>
      <p>
        Revenue cycle partners looking to extend recovery capabilities beyond
        traditional denial workflows, without adding labor or operational drag.
      </p>

      <h2>Advisory & Consulting Firms</h2>
      <p>
        Firms supporting healthcare finance, compliance, and operational
        transformation that require auditable, system-level insight.
      </p>

      <h2>Payers</h2>
      <p>
        Payers seeking reconciliation, validation, and transparency across
        adjudication outcomes and contract enforcement.
      </p>
