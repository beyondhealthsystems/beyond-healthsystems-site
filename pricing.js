      <h1>Pricing Philosophy</h1>

      <p>
        Beyond Health Systems pricing is designed to align incentives, remove
        interference, and make recovery economically rational.
      </p>

      <h2>Aligned Incentives</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond does not profit from volume, complexity, or prolonged disputes.
        Our incentives are aligned with outcomes — accuracy, recovery, and
        verified financial truth.
      </p>

      <h2>Paid After Collection</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond-Claims is compensated only when recoveries occur. If no value is
        delivered, no payment is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        This ensures that Beyond operates as a partner — not a cost center.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Interference Model</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond operates alongside existing billing systems, clearinghouses, and
        RCM vendors. It does not replace workflows or require operational
        disruption.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No workflow changes required</li>
        <li>No staffing increases</li>
        <li>No retraining burden</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recovery at Scale</h2>

      <p>
        Traditional recovery fails because partial payments and small variances
        are uneconomical to pursue manually.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond changes that equation by enabling:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recovery of partial underpayments</li>
        <li>Enforcement of contract terms at scale</li>
        <li>Unlimited resubmissions when justified</li>
        <li>Recovery of revenue historically abandoned</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>No Caps. No Artificial Limits.</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond does not impose arbitrary caps on recovery volume or submission
        attempts. If a claim is correctable and recoverable, the system pursues
        it.
      </p>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>

      <p>
        All recoveries, corrections, and outcomes are auditable. Clients can
        trace how value was identified, validated, and realized.
      </p>

      <h2>Custom Engagements</h2>

      <p>
        Pricing structures vary based on organization size, claim volume, and
        engagement scope. Final terms are tailored after a platform review.
