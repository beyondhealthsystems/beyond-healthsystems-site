      <h1>Pricing Philosophy</h1>

      <p style={{ fontSize: 18, maxWidth: 820 }}>
        Beyond Health Systems is priced to align incentives, preserve
        operational integrity, and eliminate financial interference.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paid only after collection</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No disruption to existing workflows</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No percentage of billed revenue</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No interference with payer relationships</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond-Claims operates independently alongside existing RCM systems.
        It identifies underpayments, partials, and recoverable value that
        traditional workflows ignore or abandon.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are compensated only when recovered dollars are successfully
        collected — never before.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Target</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Silent underpayments</li>
        <li>Partial payments below contract</li>
        <li>Abandoned claims deemed “uneconomic”</li>
        <li>Systemic payer enforcement drift</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Expected Impact</h2>
      <p>
        For large health systems, this typically represents a
        <strong> 6–10% uplift</strong> in collected revenue on claims
        already billed — without increasing denial rates or staff burden.
